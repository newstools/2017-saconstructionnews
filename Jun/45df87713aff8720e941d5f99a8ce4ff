The Trustees of Goldwind Africa Empowerment Trust (GWAET) are pleased to announce a scholarship for the six wind turbine service technicians pictured below to undertake the newly introduced Global Wind Organisation s (GWO) Basic Technician Training (BTT) at SARETEC.These six technicians recently completed their 5 months wind turbine service technician training at SARETEC and have excelled on the program.The Director of SARETEC, Naim Rassool is excited to partner with Goldwind Africa Pty Ltd (Founder of GWAET) in creating this opportunity for their newly qualified graduates and mentioned that: SARETEC is currently in the process of getting ready to be a certified GWO training centre to offer both the Basic Safety Training and Basic Technician Training and are looking forward to offering the recently launched BTT qualification to the top students emanating from our most recent training program. The GWO mentions that an objective for them is to develop common industry training and best practice Standards for health and safety as a vital and necessary way forward to reduce risks for personnel in the wind industry working on site and to reducing environmental risks across the wind industry.According to GWO this Standard has been developed in response to the demand for recognizable Basic Technical Training in the industry, and has been prepared in co-operation between the members of GWO based on risk assessments and factual incident and accident statistics pertaining to the installation, service and maintenance of wind turbine generators and wind power plants. Lungile Mashele, Chairperson of Goldwind Africa Empowerment Trust stated: Skills development, particularly in the renewables industry is extremely important for job creation as well as stimulating a sustainable green economy.Further to that, GWAET believes in re-training so as to absorb potential job losses from other sectors. We are proud of our students and wish them well in obtaining their qualification. Jianqing Zhou, CEO of Goldwind Africa (Founder) stated Our primary goal of the establishment of the GWAE Trust is to support skills transfer in South Africa.Through project activities Goldwind Africa intends to source traditional local skill sets and transform these skills into Global wind energy skills sets. Whilst there are delays in financial close and uncertainty of SA renewable energy markets progressing, we are glad to be able to support the advancement of Wind Service Technician graduates enrolled in the GWO programme.
