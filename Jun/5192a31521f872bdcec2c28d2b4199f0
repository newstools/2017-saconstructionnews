The construction of a new primary school in Happy Valley, Bonnievale, is expected to have been completed in October 2017.This R62 million project was commissioned by the Department of Transport and Public Works for the Western Cape Education Department.Construction started in June 2016 after the old school building was demolished. About 1 200 learners and teaching staff are using temporary classrooms until the new double-storey school is complete.Teaching facilities will comprise 32 standard classrooms (40 learners per classroom), four Grade R classrooms (30 learners per classroom), and three multi-purpose classrooms for library and computer services, arts and culture, and handwork. The complex will also have a hall with toilet facilities, an administration building, and facilities for a supervisor.Through this project, a number of people from Happy Valley and surrounding communities have benefited from short-term employment and skills training. So far, R4 million has been spent on targeted sub-contractor businesses, R2 million has gone to businesses supplying materials, and R2 million has been spent on local labour. In addition, on-site training in plumbing and carpentry has been made available since June.Join the Department on Twitter @WCGovTPW under the hashtag #constructionWC
