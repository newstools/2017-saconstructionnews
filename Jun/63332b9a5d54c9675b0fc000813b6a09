Chapman's Peak Drive has been closed until further notice after approximately 15 m3 of rock came down on the Noordhoek end, causing significant damage to two catch fences and the road surface.Geotechnical engineers visited the site and put a remedial action plan in place. The Department of Transport and Public Works believes that the road will be closed for three to four weeks, and will make every effort to open the road as soon as it is safe to do so.Motorists can expect intermittent road closures on Chapman s Peak Drive this winter whenever high-risk weather conditions make the road unsafe. The area is very exposed to strong winds, and there is a high risk of rockfalls and mudslides down the steep mountain slopes.When the road is closed, motorists are requested to use Ou Kaapse Weg.
