The Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) has started slope repairs on the R326 near Stanford.This R10 million project to address the safety hazard caused by erosion at two sites is expected to have been completed in mid-2017. There will be daytime stop/ go closures in the Akkedisberg Pass where necessary.Work will include repairs to existing slopes and measures to minimise the risk of future damage by means of fills, gabions, meshing and pinning, as well as better stormwater management.DTPW is committed to creating short-term Expanded Public Works Programme employment and skills training opportunities. A total of R2 million will be spent on targeted enterprises and 750 person-days of work will be created for people from the Overstrand municipal area.The high-quality road infrastructure that DTPW provides is an important component of a safe and effective transport system, and an enabler of economic and social development in the Western Cape.Follow the Department on Twitter @WCGovTPW under the hashtag #roadworksWC
