The Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) has started a project to rehabilitate the R317 between Robertson and Bonnievale.This R205 million project is expected to have been completed in mid-2018.This road linking the two towns is a single carriageway surfaced road with narrow shoulders, constructed over 40 years ago. As traffic has increased over time, the road has reached its operational capacity. A total of 13 km will be rehabilitated, and safety will be improved by widening the road and the Cogmanskloof Bridge. Other work will include the rebuilding and replacement of culverts, the reconstruction of 5 km of road through the centre of Bonnievale, and the installation of sewer and water services.In some places, stop/ go controls will be necessary. At the Cogmanskloof Bridge and certain other places, traffic lights will be installed. Flagmen/women are expected to control traffic at other intersections under construction.DTPW is committed to creating short-term Expanded Public Works Programme employment and skills training opportunities. A total of R25 million will be spent on targeted enterprises and 30 000 person-days of work will be created for people from the Cape Winelands municipal area.DTPW values the importance of high-quality road infrastructure as an important component of an effective transport system. This infrastructure also makes a substantial contribution to productivity, safety, and economic development in the Western Cape.
