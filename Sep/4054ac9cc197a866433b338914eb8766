Human Settlements Minister Bonginkosi Madikizela launched the R1.8 billion Belhar CBD housing project, during a sod turning ceremony.Upon completion in 2022, this second phase housing project will yield 4 000 mixed-use, mixed-income and mixed-tenure housing opportunities.Speaking during the launch on-site behind Unibell train station, Minister Madikizela said this was the first housing project of its kind to accommodate students in the province. During the Fees Must Fall campaign the issue of students accommodation was raised sharply and this project will address that by providing over 500 student units. We know it is not much but it will be something, said Madikizela.Another ground-breaking innovation in this housing project is the offering of sectional titles to the Breaking New Ground (BNG) beneficiaries. These are people who earn up to R3 500 and would traditionally get free houses.According to Minister Madikizela, offering free houses all the time is not a permanent solution. There are about 500 000 people who can afford to pay for their houses but earn too little to qualify for a bond, or too much to qualify for a free house. We cannot ignore these people because in order to work effectively and efficiently as the government, we need to have revenue and that is what this working class is able to assist with, said Mr Madikizela.Other housing opportunities that will be available in the Belhar CBD project include:Public amenities in close proximity to this residential area include two universities, public transport and shopping centres.The first phase of this project has been completed. It consists of over 600 units.
