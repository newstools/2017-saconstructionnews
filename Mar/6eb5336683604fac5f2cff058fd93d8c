Royal HaskoningDHV with its integrated, innovative approach and strong track record in transport planning and mobility in South Africa, was invited to partner with the Dutch Cycling Embassy.Supported by the Netherlands Embassy in Gauteng and the Dutch Consulate in Cape Town, to conduct an investigation into cycling for improved mobility, upliftment of communities and enhanced economic growth.In partnership with the Dutch Cycling Embassy comprising Dutch cycling experts working together to promote cycling and share the Dutch cycling culture worldwide, Royal HaskoningDHV facilitated a fact-finding mission earlier this year to see what people on the ground think of cycling for improved mobility, upliftment of communities and enhanced economic growth. This investigation was conducted in collaboration with Government Institutions and Metro Municipalities.Ivan Reutener, Transport Knowledge Group Head at Royal HaskoningDHV says, The rise of digital tools along with the demand for greater sustainability see us heralding in a new era of transport solutions in our cities. As an avid cyclist myself, I see great opportunities to combine advances made in the field of ITS and complementing these with our sustainable approach in the field of NMT, which not only makes transport more efficient, but also more accessible to communities across South Africa. With an established track record in a number of NMT cycling projects in various municipalities across the country, Royal HaskoningDHV has demonstrated expertise in integrating transport solutions with spatial development so as to provide a long term sustainable approach in helping cities to solve their congestion issues. Reutener states, As an international consultant in delivering smart and sustainable transport solutions, we are able to provide a broad spectrum of expertise in this very niche market, leveraging our global experience and local knowledge to ensure that solutions are specific and tailored to the South African reality .Working in close collaboration with the Ambassador and Consulate General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Royal HaskoningDHV was invited to exchange ideas and share insights into our learnings in developing a sustainable urban transport network as part of #cocreateSA at the Mobility Indaba (6 10 October) in Cape Town, and the Cycle Indaba (11 &amp; 12 October) in Johannesburg.#cocreateSA is a platform for South Africa and the Netherlands to collaborate and exchange ideas and innovations for a sustainable future. The key focus was for participants to collaborate and share knowledge in order to develop a sustainable mobility charter that will function as a guide for all stakeholders, including the South African government, to co-create solutions for mobility challenges.Ms. Bonnie Horbach, Consul General of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, said: The mixed backgrounds and active contributions of all the participants have ensured that the charter is both aspirational and practically relevant. We would like to thank Royal HaskoningDHV for its indispensable contribution that was vital to the successes that we have enjoyed. Other knowledge sharing initiatives spearheaded by Royal HaskoningDHV this year have included an interactive workshop with a senior delegation of city and transport planning officials from South Africa, focusing on cycling as an integral part of a sustainable and safe transport system. The company is also involved in a research project for the City of Tshwane in collaboration with the University of Pretoria and Enterprise UP for a cycle share scheme.For more information, please visit:
