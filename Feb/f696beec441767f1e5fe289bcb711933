Consulting Engineers South Africa (CESA) and the National Treasury is hosting a seminar from 28 February to 01 March 2017 at Birchwood Hotel &amp; OR Tambo Conference Centre, as part of a series of nationwide seminars to enhance and improve Public Sector procurement in the construction sector by designing a procurement system that is better able to deliver value for money, while minimizing the scope for corruption.The purpose of the seminars are to introduce and explain the recent watershed publication of the National Treasury Standard for Infrastructure Procurement and Delivery Management (SIPDM) which enables the supply chain management system for infrastructure to be separated from that of general goods and services. This standard is required to be implemented by all organs of state which are subject to the PFMA with effect from 1 July 2016, and those subject to the MFMA by 1 July 2017.The seminars will be held over two days to enable participants to gain insights into an in-depth understanding of the practical implementation of the SIPDM. Seminar participants will be provided with templates, Performa documents, guidance document, comprehensive workshop notes and will be invited to undertake a multiple choice question online examination at a later date to verify their understanding of the SIPDM.CESA agreed to support National Treasury with the capacitation of Public Sector officials and Private Sector built environment practitioners, in the effective implementation of this standard. This resulted in CESA and the National Treasury signing a Memorandum of Understanding in November, last year.Seminars will also be held in Durban, Cape Town, East London, Port Elizabeth, Kimberley and Bloemfontein over the next six months as follows:Attendance is no longer limited to professionally registered Built Environment Professionals but anyone who wishes to be trained in the SIPDM may attend. Please note that a cost recovery fee will be payable. Details regarding venues in the regions will be publicized once they are available.
