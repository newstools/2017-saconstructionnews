The Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) is assisting the Red Cross Hospital Trust by overseeing the construction of two Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) and ancillary facilities at the Red Cross War Memorial Children s Hospital. This R54-million project was commissioned by the Trust in September 2015.As part of Phase 1 works, which reached practical completion in August 2016, alterations were made to accommodate a 15-bed PICU ward in the C1 wing. Phase 2 is currently under way and is scheduled for completion in September 2017. This includes fitting out a previously completed ward extension into a new 14-bed PICU ward as well as a 10-bed Neonatal High-Care ward, both in the C2 wing.The PICU beds, nurse stations and service rooms have been designed to streamline work flow. Large windows allow staff members to monitor patients at all times. The design has maximised the amount of natural light in the wards. In order to encourage the families of children to visit and be part of the healing process, family facilities have been provided, including waiting areas, kitchenettes, parent sleep rooms, and counselling rooms. New staff offices in the D floor wing are under construction to provide space for more intensive care staff to perform the necessary clinical, educational and research duties.Once the project has been completed, the hospital will have more beds and significantly better intensive care services for critically ill and injured children. This project would not have been possible without the contributions of the Red Cross Children s Hospital Trust that has funded a number of job opportunities during the duration of the project.
