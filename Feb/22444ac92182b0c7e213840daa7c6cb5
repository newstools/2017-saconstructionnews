Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport, Ismail Vadi, has launched a R50 million road rehabilitation project between Meyerton and Alberton/Katlehong in Sedibeng. This is an old road that is nearing the end of its serviceable life and needs to be fully upgraded. It provides a link between Meyerton and Alberton/Katlehong and serves as an alternative route to the R59, which is an extremely busy road, MEC Vadi said on Friday.The six-month project is scheduled to be completed by August and the contractor was appointed using the Gauteng Provincial Government s open tender system.The road under construction has two rivers that cross it and can help to stimulate industrial development in an area that is largely rural and agricultural in nature. A key challenge in this region is unemployment and the low rate of economic growth. I hope that the upgrading of this road will strengthen the links between industries in Sedibeng and Ekurhuleni, create jobs and promote local economic growth, MEC Vadi said.An important component of the project is local sub-contracting and labour employment, particularly for women, youth and the disabled.
