The first phase of a R6-million Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) refurbishment project at Leeuwenhof Estate has been completed.The project started in March 2016, with Phase 2 set to commence once funding has been approved. The project created work opportunities for 40 people from the City of Cape Town municipal area.Phase 1 work included general repairs and renovations, landscaping and improving the drainage and retaining structures around and against the buildings. Some of the key works were the restoration of deteriorating Batavian floor tiles, repairs to damp and cracked walls, and the replacement of parts of the roof. The landscaping component of the project included replacing plants to suit historical and traditional courtyard themes.Project leader Alvino February says the highlight for him was to be part of such a high-profile Public Works initiative at the official residence of the political head of the Western Cape Government. We have started resolving the underground water issue and restoring the heritage estate of Leeuwenhof to a more appropriate state, February added.Premier Helen Zille and her family were in residence while the works were being done. She expressed her thanks for a job well done to the Department s Public Works component, the members of the project team members, and external service providers.
