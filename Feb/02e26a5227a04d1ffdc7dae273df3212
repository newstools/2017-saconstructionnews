A Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) project to upgrade the K53 testing track and build a new vehicle testing centre at the Gene Louw Traffic College in Brackenfell will be launched on 10 March 2017.This R26-million project reached practical completion in August 2015, and the new facilities were registered once the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) was satisfied that all applicable standards had been met.These state-of-the-art facilities are expected to further build the College s proud reputation for producing highly skilled traffic officers for the Western Cape and beyond. Previously, students had to travel to the Paarl Driving Licence Testing Centre for K53 practical training.In addition to using the new facilities for training, DTPW will use the equipment to test vehicle roadworthiness during joint operations, and the K53 track to test drivers. It is envisaged that learner transport vehicles in the Brackenfell traffic service area under contract to the Western Cape Education Department will be inspected there. DTPW is continually reviewing its approach to traffic law enforcement training to build best practice. The new facilities will make a significant contribution to road safety in Cape Town and surrounds.
