Work on a Department of Transport and Public Works project to rehabilitate a 33 km section of the R341 between Oudtshoorn and De Rust is progressing well.This R213 million project started in January 2017 and is scheduled for completion early in 2018.The project includes upgrades and resealing of portions of the road as well as the widening of the Cango River Bridge. Comprehensive rehabilitation of the road is necessary, as well as design improvements to enhance traffic flow and road safety. Motorists can expect 15-minute delays at various locations between Oudtshoorn and De Rust.The project is creating a number of short-term Expanded Public Works Programme employment and skills training opportunities. A total of R29 million will be spend on targeted contractor businesses and 60 000 person-days of work will be created for people from the local municipal area.The high-quality road infrastructure that the Department provides is an important component of a safe and effective transport system, and an enabler of economic and social development in the Western Cape.
