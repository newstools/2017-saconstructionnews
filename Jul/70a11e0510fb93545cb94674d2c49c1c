The Department of Transport and Public Works apologises to road users for a delay in the completion of a R52 million contract to reseal, rehabilitate and perform structural maintenance on 20 km of road in Saasveld and Wilderness Heights.Unexpected site difficulties mean it will no longer be possible to open the Saasveld section of road to two-way traffic as originally planned. We hope to have the road opened to one-way traffic by mid-August but this is subject to a final assessment of the remaining portion of the project.We thank local residents for the cooperation and patience, and will keep them informed of progress through planned public information sessions.
