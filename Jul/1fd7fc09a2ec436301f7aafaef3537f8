The National Home Builders Registration Council has introduced new builder registration and enrolment certificates with stringent security features in its effort to limit fraud and keep up with evolving security technologies.The new security measures include an embedded watermark during paper manufacturing; a chemically sensitive paper; micro printed text; background image printed with fine line security and control numbers done with an ink that cannot be rubbed off. We have enhanced the security features of the new certificates based on industry standards following a number of reported fraudulent activities that posed a risk to the warranty fund and these needed to be managed effectively, said NHBRC Business Services Executive, Ms Thitinti Moshoeu.NHBRC encourages homeowners, potential home buyers and financial institutions to familiarise themselves with these enhanced certificates and continue to exercise caution when dealing with contractors/ developers/builders by ensuring that they verify builder registration and home enrolment with the NHBRC.
