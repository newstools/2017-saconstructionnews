A Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) project to rehabilitate 7 km of the N2 between Borcherds Quarry Rd and the R300, and to add a third lane in both directions, is 78% complete.This R186 million project began in January 2016 and is expected to have been completed in September 2017, if everything goes according to plan.By the end of April 2017, the contractor had completed all the gravel and crushed stone works. Phase 2 work is progressing well. This includes the rehabilitation of the existing middle and left lanes; the construction of the final riding surface; the installation of street lighting; and road marking.Once completed, this project is expected to benefit the 82 000 vehicles that travel on this section of the N2 every day. The upgrade will improve the carrying capacity of the road, especially for buses and taxis during peak periods. Ride quality, safety and visibility will all be improved.Many people have benefited directly from the short-term employment and skills training opportunities that the project has delivered. Contract expenditure to date is R16,5 million for targeted enterprises. A total of 18 526 person-days of work have been created so far for people residing in the City of Cape Town municipal area. A total of 49 men and 12 women are currently working on the project.DTPW is aware that roadworks create frustration and assures road users that the construction team is doing everything in its power to facilitate the free flow of traffic. All possible steps will be taken to minimise delays, especially during the upcoming winter period. Motorists are encouraged to be patient and exercise caution in the interest of road safety at all times.
