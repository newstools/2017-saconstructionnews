Its strong technical support for manufacturers of precast concrete products allows admixture expert, CHRYSO Southern Africa to help customers improve their cost per cubic metre and boost their bottom lines.With global research and development behind its solutions, CHRYSO helps manufacturers to improve their efficiencies, whether by extending the workability of their concrete, increasing its strength or enhancing productivity through strategic technical interventions. We look at the customer s production facility and seek ways to optimise processes, not only in terms of concrete mix designs, but where possible in other plant processes that could be improved, says Kabelo Sepotokele, sales manager (precast segment) at CHRYSO Southern Africa. We recommend a particular product only after considering the material used, analysing the customer s requirements, and assessing options to suit their application. Sepotokele highlights the importance of taking a holistic view of the value added by CHRYSO admixtures and additives, so that solutions can be measured not in terms of the cost per litre of chemicals, but in terms of the cost per cubic metre of concrete used.He says CHRYSO s solutions can save on the quantity of cement used, electricity consumed and labour required; these factors all contribute to the final cost per cubic metre of concrete used in precast applications, so any savings can potentially benefit profitability. Manufacturers of concrete pipes, for instance, must ensure they are achieving the quickest possible turnaround of each unit, as this has significant cost implications for the business, he says. The use of steam is a common method of increasing temperatures to accelerate the strengthening process. Our product range includes chemical accelerators that reduce the time required to steam the product, or eliminate the use of steam altogether. CHRYSO invests 3% of its sales in research and development, with a central laboratory in Sermaises, France, manned by about 55 researchers; CHRYSO Southern Africa has nine local laboratories.
