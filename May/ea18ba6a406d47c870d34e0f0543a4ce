A Department of Transport and Public Works (DTPW) project to reseal, rehabilitate and perform structural maintenance on 20 km of road in George and Wilderness is nearing completion.This R52 million project is expected to have been completed in June 2017, if everything goes according to plan.In George, work is under way from the intersection of the R404 and the R102 near George Airport to the intersection of the R102 and York Street. The rehabilitation over the Gwaing River Bridge is complete, as well as repairing defects and application of texture slurry.In Wilderness, work is under way from the roundabout intersection of Waterside Road and George Road. Repairs to defects and the application of texture slurry are complete, and the clearing of vegetation is 90% complete. The resealing of Whites Road and the rehabilitation of Hoogte Road recently commenced and is progressing well. During construction, only local residents will be permitted to access these roads.The Department is committed to providing Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) work opportunities and to developing small businesses. As of end of March 2017, about 9-000 person-days of work have been created, and about R2 million has been spent on targeted enterprises. DTPW is aware that delays are frustrating, but some delays during construction are inevitable. The high-quality road infrastructure that it provides is an important component of a safe and effective transport system, and an enabler of economic and social development in the Western Cape.
